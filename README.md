# ConcurrentPrintServiceAPI
This project is a simulation of a multithreaded printing service designed to demonstrate and explore key concepts in concurrent programming. It implements a multi-stage producer-consumer pattern involving multiple producers, multiple consumers, and the management of shared, finite resources.

## Architecture

The service operates as a pipeline with distinct roles handled by different threads:

1. **Job Arrival:** The **Print Job Receiver** thread acts as the first producer. It simulates the arrival of new print jobs and places them into the `Job Queue`.
2. **Resource Provisioning:** In parallel, the **Paper Refill** thread acts as a second producer. On signal, it replenishes the `Paper Supply` in the requesting printer when it lacks sufficient paper to process the job at the front of the `Job Queue`.
3. **Job Servicing:** The two **Service Threads (Printers)** act as the final consumers. They concurrently pull jobs from the `Job Queue` and simulate the "printing" process, after which the job is complete.</details>
